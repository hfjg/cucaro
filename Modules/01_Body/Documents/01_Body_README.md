# CuCaRo Body
Since CuCaRo is focused on function (and not on design or appearance of the original), its body is made of a [commercial storage box](https://www.eurobox.de/produktkatalog-eb/stapelbehaelter-geschlossen-400x300x235-mm.html) that holds all the components.

## Components
1. Raspberry Pi as main controller
1. Battery and [BatMan](https://github.com/hfjg/cucaro/blob/master/Modules/02_BatMan/Documents/02_BatMan_README.md)
2. Axis bearings and differential
